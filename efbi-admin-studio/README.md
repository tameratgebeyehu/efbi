# EFBI Admin Studio

A private, localhost-only operations interface for the Ethiopian Future Builders Initiative.

## Run locally

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5174/`.

The app reads the ignored Firebase environment files in `../academy-v2`. Access requires both a verified Firebase email and the `admin: true` custom claim. Authentication is saved only for the browser session.

## Checks

```powershell
npm run build
npm run lint
```

## Non-negotiable boundary

Do not deploy this directory. Do not expose its development port to the internet. Do not add an `/admin` route to the student app. Do not place service-account credentials or role-management logic in browser code.

Phase 9 is intentionally read-only. The visible operational areas remain locked until later phases add validated schemas and Firestore rule tests.

See `../ADMIN_STUDIO.md` for role provisioning, revocation, architecture, and the Phase 10 gate.
